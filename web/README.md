## DevHub

DevHub aims to become the "Central Nervous System" for the growing gov developer community.  We also describe it like a "wayfinding" tool for digital product teams. 

It will provide a comprehensive inventory of relevant internal and external documentation, open source components, services, APIs and data for internal and external developers who are building government products, or want to build their own products

It will also be a platform through which government teams can share their developer resources for discovery and use by internal and external developers.

It will provide an inventory of ongoing open product development products, components and teams

The resources will be collected into curated various focused kits/topics of resources needed to build particular types of systems, assist teams at a point in their lifecycle, support persona specific-workflows, etc. 

It will also provide a aeans to seed “prosumer”/community behaviours. For example, it will be possible to view source/fork/comment/PR on many of the elements in the DevHub.

## Technical Details

This application is a static site and is generated using [GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby).

Here are some of the other components/technologies used by DevHub: 

- ReactJS
- GraphQL
- StorybookJS

## Third-Party Products/Libraries
- Algolia (for searching) 
- GatsbyJS  


## Project Status
In Development

## Documentation

## Getting Started
* Setup a Developer Account with [Algolia](https://algolia.com). Use the __Community__ version.


## Deployment (Local Development For App-Web)

* Requires **Node 10** and **npm 6**
* Clone this repo
* Change into web project directory `cp web`
* run: `npm install`
* copy and update your env file
* `cp .env.production.example .env.production`
* to start development server run: `npm run dev`
* to build a production version run: `npm run build`
* to view production build run: `npx gatsby serve`
* to run prettier: `npm run prettify`
* to run test suites: `npm test`
* to run storybook: `npm run storybook`

## Deployment (Docker Compose for Local Development)

* Requires **Docker**  & **Docker Compose** (and for Windows users. some `bash` compatible environment)
* clone the repo to your workstation
* from the root of your local repo, run `./preview.sh`

An pre-built "previewer" image will be pulled down from Docker Hub to your local workstation and fired up.  It will likely take a few minutes the first time you do this.  Once the image has been pulled down, DevHub will kick in and process the content defined in the `registry` directory.  After a few minutes, you'll be able to peek at the DevHub running locally at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

At this point, you can modify contents of the `registry` directory (adding resources or topics for example), or rebuild and preview locally based on changes in repositories that area already referenced in the `registry`.  If you make changes to the `registry` or remote content, you willneed to restart the previewer via ^C and running `./preview.sh` again - the hot reload does not apply to `registry` or remote content.

## Openshift Single Deployment

1. Pre-requisistes:

  - sign up for Algolia and obtain your app id, search token, and admin key
  - run the algolia build secret in your build namespace 
  ```
    oc process -f openshift/templates/web/algolia-build.secret.yaml \ 
    -p ALGOLIA_ADMIN_KEY= \
    -p GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID= \
    -p GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY= | \
     oc apply -f -
  ```
  - build a production version of the devhub locally or in a pipeline to produce an Algolia Index `npm run build`

  - run the algolia deploy secret in your deploy namespace
   ```
    oc process -f openshift/templates/web/algolia-deployment.secret.yaml \ 
    -p GATSBY_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=... \
    -p GATSBY_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=... \
    -p GATSBY_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY=... | \
     oc apply -f -
  ```
 
  - create a [generic github access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token) and then run the gh secret in your build namespace
  ```
    oc process -f openshift/templates/web/gh.secret.yaml \ 
    -p GITHUB_TOKEN=... \
    -p NAMESPACE=... | \
     oc apply -f -
  ```

  - if you have access to eventbrite you may grab an api key from there and run the eventbrite secret in the builder namespace (this is optional)
    ```
    oc process -f openshift/templates/web/eventbrite.secret.yaml \ 
    -p EVENT_BRITE_API_KEY=... \
    -p NAMESPACE=... | \
     oc apply -f -
  ```

2. Build the Image

   ```
   oc process -f openshift/templates/web/bc.yaml \
   -p NAME=devhub-app-web \
   -p SUFFIX=... \
   -p GATSBY_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=... \
   -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_URL=... \
   -p SOURCE_REPOSITORY_REF=... \
   -p GITHUB_ISSUE_SEARCH=false \
   -p DOCUMIZE_SEARCH=false \
   -p ROCKET_CHAT_SEARCH=false \
   -p LOGIN_FEATURE=false | |
   oc apply -f -
   ```
   > the true/false params require external integrations in order to work
## Development Guide/Considerations

   Devhub leverages different sources of content via the `gatsby-source-plugin`. These sources are
   connected in a variety of ways to produce meaningful connections to build things like topics, and navigational
   elements. Because different source plugins produce different schemas, a __minimum schema__ is extended from each
   node type that is to be leveraged as a 'card' in the devhub. More information can be found on this [here](./docs/devhubCardSpec.md)

### Authentication
   Devhub utilizes __Authorization Code Flow__. This is provided automatically by the app via `Keycloak Javascript Adapter` and the hook 
   `useKeycloak`.
   ```js
      import React from 'react'
      import { useKeycloak } from '@react-keycloak/web';

      const MyComponent = () => {
         const [keycloak] = useKeycloak();
         // need to ensure keycloak obj has been initialized before checking properties
         const authenticated = keycloak && keycloak.authenticated;
         if(auth) {
            // do something here
         } else {
            // foo
         }
      }
   ```
