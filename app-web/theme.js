Emotion theming object

We are transitioning from common elements such as colors, background colors being abstracted away into
a themes provider. This is a very common practice now a days and makes it maintain themes on the fly
docs on theming is here https://emotion.sh/docs/theming#___gatsby

Docs on emotion https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction

--- the idea is to introduce emotion early and slowly replace css modules with emotion styled components
when and as needed. This is a slow processes but will lead to better and more maintaible styling in the long run.
