The system makes it easier and faster to build custom B.C. government websites and applications. \n\nComponents are collectively built by the government community, meet accessibility standards and are open for input and improvement.\n\nUse the Design System if you’re building custom B.C. government and applications. For more information about applying for external URLs, contact the B.C. government Joint Working Group.\n\n## The Team\n\nThe Design System is managed by a team of designers and developers and the government community. The system is a part of the DevHub, a project by the Developers’ Exchange that brings together UI/interface and back-end resources for digital teams.\n\nKelsey Singbeil – Team Lead, Service Design\n\nBryan Smith – Service Design Specialist\n\nOri Nevares – Service Design Specialist\n\n## The Community\n\nThe system is collectively built and maintained by the government community. It’s open source, which means that anybody can provide input, offer suggestions and get involved.\n\nShare your feedback to make this resource better for everyone.\n\n## How the system works\n\nHow might we improve people’s interaction with B.C. government digital products and services?\n\nThe system is a part of the answer.\n\nIt provides developers and designers with the tools they need to build great digital government products and services. The system is collectively built and managed, so all the tools and resources are the product of the community.\n\nAs part of this, we are committed to making all the tools and resources we create:\n\n**Maintained**  \nThe community and Design System management team will support the maintenance and development of new resources and tools. This means you can flag issues and they’ll be addressed, discuss rationale and directly chat with the management team whenever you need.\n\n**Collaborative**\nThe system is only valuable if the community finds it valuable. If a tool or resource isn’t meeting your needs, tell us why and work with us to make it better. We’ll also come to you – in your office, at your desk and share what’s new, ask what you need and share how you can get involved.\n\n**Open**\nThe system is built in GitHub and meant to be shared and improved by everyone. The code is open source and our work is in the open. We are transparent about how choices are made and tools are improved. Ask us…anything.\n\n**Contribute to the Design System**\n\n***Help with design***\n-   Suggest a component\n-   Improve documentation\n\n***Help with code***\n-  Code contribution guide\n-   Report an issue\n\n***Help with usability***\n-   Component discussions\n-   Provide research findings\n\n',
